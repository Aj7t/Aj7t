## ðŸ‘¥ Recommendation

Here's a recommendation from Ahmad Quadri, a first-degree connection who worked with me:

> Ahmad Quadri, who attended Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, and worked with me on the same team, has this to say:

"I strongly recommend Ajit for his dynamic approach, consistent dedication to work, and his ability to come up with innovative solutions. He's an invaluable team member who consistently delivers outstanding results. I like his approach while solving problems or bugs; he does not try to patch some code, instead he comes up with the ideas and solves them efficiently and elegantly."
